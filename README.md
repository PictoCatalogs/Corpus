## Project

This project aims to encode and study Pictorialist Photography Exhibition Catalogs from the Metropolitan Museum of Art Library (Joyce F. Menschel Photography Library), available [here](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/libraries-and-research-centers/watson-digital-collections/rare-materials-in-the-met-libraries/pictorialist-photography-exhibition-catalogs-1891-1914). 

This repository is under construction. For the moment, it only contains catalogs of the Photo-Club de Paris exhibitions.
